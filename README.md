To use this, you will need to install GhostScript and Tesseract.  I have verified that they can be install via apt on Linux and brew on Mac.

To set up on Mac:

`brew install tesseract`

`brew install ghostscript`



Then execute the ocr shell script.  A demo pdf file is in the repository.

`./ocr.sh`
